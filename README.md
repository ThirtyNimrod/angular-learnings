# Angular Learnings

Welcome to the **Angular Learnings** repository! This project is a personal initiative to get better at Angular and frontend development by building hands-on projects and small proof-of-concept (POC) applications. The ultimate goal is to improve UI development skills and integrate them seamlessly with my Langgraph backend, enabling the creation of powerful end-to-end AI applications.

## Purpose

The repository contains various Angular-based projects where I experiment with:

- UI design and development using Angular.
- Building interactive user interfaces.
- Integrating Angular frontend with Langgraph backend (AI and NLP).
- Creating small applications that demonstrate best practices and common patterns in Angular development.

## Projects

This repository will contain:

- Hands-on Angular UI components.
- Integrations with Langgraph backend for end-to-end AI applications.
- Small, self-contained POCs showcasing different Angular features and tools.

Feel free to explore, contribute, or learn from these projects. You might find small snippets, reusable components, and overall techniques useful for your own projects.

## How to Contribute
