# angular-learnings
angular-learnings is a collection of hands-on projects and small proof-of-concept (POC) applications to learn Angular and enhance frontend development skills. The repository serves as a sandbox where I experiment with building UI components, integrating them with my Langgraph backend, and working on end-to-end AI applications.
